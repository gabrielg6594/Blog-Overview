# Blog-Overview

## Context: 
My freedom project is a Calendar that is to help with keeping track of events made from Javascript,html, css, and JSON.

## Content: 
My project would have a very mediocre effect as many people already are interacting with a kind of calendar to keep their tasks and things to do in order while it will show how mine takes into account differences from global, social, and economic categories and how my project would do in those areas.

## Implications: 
My project is a Midnight blue calendar that has a few positives and negatives that people have pointed out. Some of the positives and negatives that will have a impact on society are:

### Positives:

- Made with Javascript which makes it saved in memory until refreshed.
- Does not require a login username and password.
- No overly complicated options on how to be used.

### Negatives:

- Does not save events, everything is temporary and held in memory.
- No editing feature so if there is a mistake there is no way to fix it.
- There are no added features that people would like to have, no reminders.


Some categories to consider are the Global, Social, and Economic categories and how this project will do in those areas.
Global - Some other bigger corporations that have their own calendars that have features and other options that my calendar does not have would be better for people to decide to use.
Social - It would be easier to share between individuals as there is no long list of things to do in order to have access to the calendar.
Economic - It could help people remind themselves what they were doing at times and the infrastructure is very simple.
